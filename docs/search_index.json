["index.html", "W201 Portfolio Welcome!", " W201 Portfolio Yuqing Grace Lin MIDS Fall 2017 Welcome! This site contains the data-related ideas of Grace Lin, a student of the MIDS program at University of California, Berkeley. These are a couple of ideas I would like to explore. Figure .: Opportunity Scoring! Abstract of my first cool idea Sales teams are often surrounded with an enormous number of opportunities, which makes picking winning opportunities very challenging, if not impossible. Many sales teams lack rapid and real-time access to actionable insights, intelligent recommendations and collaboration tools that can show them which opportunities to prioritize and which deals may require a bit of extra effort. Using predictive analytics, our team can create automated scoring rules to prioritize the highest value deals. In addition, this will let salespeople forecast revenue and bookings numbers based on opportunities currently in their pipeline. Scoring the opportunities provides a consistent methodology to prioritize the right opportunities sales teams should be pursuing in their pipeline. Opportunity scoring is a powerful tool to help them separate the winners from the losers with insights from business intelligence and predictive analytics. Abstract of my second cool idea China’s online English education market is estimated to grow at more than 50 per cent a year to 90 billion USD by 2020. AMERHOPE can provide online education platform that offers an American elementary education experience to Chinese students. We will hire qualified teachers with experience in the North American classroom to give one-on-one, fully immersive lessons delivered via our platform and based on U.S. Standards. The process will adhere to a flipped classroom model, entailing a pre-class video that introduce key learning points, interactive one-on-one instruction that reinforce learning objectives, and follow-up, post class homework. As we attract more students and teachers, data science can help us match students with teachers based on their learning or teaching pattern. For example, some students like patient teachers while others tend to study better with encouraging ones. Likewise, some teachers enjoy working with smart and creative students while others tend to get along with obedient ones. We will apply machine learning to study both students’ and teachers’ behaviors to provide a more tailored curricula.

["my-first-cool-idea-oppscore.html", "1 My first cool idea - OppScore 1.1 Why need OppScore? 1.2 How to score? 1.3 Time to Score!", " 1 My first cool idea - OppScore 1.0.0.1 Keywords Opportunity scoring 1.1 Why need OppScore? Every one of us fails at times. Then, we look back in retrospect and wonder how things could have gone differently. But if we could start our endeavors with this hindsight, we could avoid many failures. Sales teams are often surrounded with an enormous number of opportunities, which makes picking winning one very challenging, if not impossible. Many sales teams lack rapid and real-time access to actionable insights, intelligent recommendations and collaboration tools that can show them which deals to prioritize and which may require a bit of extra effort. OppScore is a product for companies to purchase and then deploy to their sales teams. Using predictive analytics, OppScore creates automated scoring rules to prioritize the highest value deals. In addition, this will let salespeople forecast revenue and bookings numbers currently in their pipeline. 1.2 How to score? Using machine learning techniques, OppScore scores sales opportunities to determine the likelihood of winning a deal. Sales reps can then use these scores to prioritize the deals they are working on. OppSocre use text-mining techniques to scrape data from open-source platforms. In addition, it takes the following feature specifications into consideration: Revenue potential Customer historical transactions Resource requirements Familiarity Conflicts Cost of sales Customer relationships The responsible sales representative’s past performance OppScore creates a predictive model based on these features from all the historical opportunities and consider whether they successfully converted into win deals. The model considers all the attributes including custom fields and identifies which attributes are most correlated to successful conversions. The output is a predictive model with weightings for each attribute. This model can then be applied to predict whether it will result in a successful conversion. Once we have defined all the relevant criteria and applied the scoring, OppScore then creates a matrix or dashboard that helps visualize which opportunities will deliver the greatest value with the lowest amount of risk or cost. 1.3 Time to Score! OppScore provides a consistent methodology to prioritize the right opportunities sales teams should be pursuing in their pipeline. It helps them separate the winners from the losers with insights from business intelligence and predictive analytics. Its powerful database provides solution to build models which can be applied to companies in new markets as well. "],

Affluent middle-class families have more demands for qualified native English speakers to teach their children both English and other subjects in English. However, with limited resources, the student to foreign teacher ratio is only 40 to 1 in urban areas. It is even harder for students in rural areas to receive qualified education. On the other side, more teachers are exploring ways to benefit through cross-cultural and personal enrichment. AMERHOPE’s vision is to provide a platform to connect English teachers in America, UK, Australia, and Canada with students in China. Internet-enabled artificial intelligence can help provide more tailor-made curricula after online assessment. 2.2 What AMERHOPE Can Do AMERHOPE can provide online education platform that offers an American elementary education experience to Chinese students. We will hire qualified teachers with experience in the North American classroom to give one-on-one, fully immersive lessons delivered via our platform and based on U.S. Standards.

We will apply machine learning to study both students’ and teachers’ behaviors to provide a more tailored curricula. 2.3 Don’t Miss This Opportunity Our service is tapping into the demand among Chinese middle-class parents to have their children learn English in the most authentic way and the desire of underpaid English teachers to make more money during their spare time. Do not miss this opportunity to help the younger generation build a better future! 2.4 Reference: Chen, Lydia. 2016. “Golden Age of China’s Education Industry”.
